Once upon a time there was a man who lived in Venezuela. This man loved to read books and listen to music in his apartment. The man had not been able to find a job for years after getting fired at his previous employment insitution, a life insurance firm. All he wished for was to be able to retire on the beach and watch the surfers as he lounged with a book and ice cold Mr. Pibb soda. He had once had a wife but had mutually decided to separate as the love had been lost for years. However that was over 15 years ago and loneliness had crept up on him over many years of serene isolation. This quiet life was brought to an abrupt halt when, one day, his apartment was raided by local police with no reason at all. (idk what they meant by a story lol just kinda wrote this...)
The local police said "whoops wrong apartment" and promptly left. The man was startled by the whole encounter with law enforcement so he left his apartment to go for a walk and clear his head. While the man was walking he was thinking about life as one does when they go for walks. As he was thinking about how much longer he could survive off his savings and woman suddenly grabbed his arm and as he turns around to see a group of suspicious men in black suites running after the woman. Without thinking the man quickly sweeps the woman off her feet and runs down the block and and into a dark alley where he wall walked and jumped over a 10 foot barbed wire fence. While he was running with the woman in his arms he quickly glanced back to see the men in black suites had stopped at the fence and glared at him. The man ran out of the dark alley, and to his convenience his apartment was right across the street. As fast as he could, the man carried the woman inside the apartment building, ran up the stairs and into his apartment, and locked the door after placing the woman on the couch.
